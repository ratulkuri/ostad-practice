## Eat and Split

"Eat and Split" is a small app that helps you manage expenses among friends during dining. You can create a list of friends, add their names, profile pictures, and initial balances. When you select a friend, you can enter the total restaurant bill, your individual expenses, and specify who is paying. The app calculates how much each person owes or is owed, and displays the split amount under their name in the friend list.
